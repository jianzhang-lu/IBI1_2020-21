My reflection:
I did most of things well. But I found difficulties in the command ‘git revert’ at first.
Fortunately, I solved it with the help of friends and teachers.
Also, the rate of pushing and cloning is really low. 
Therefore, I take much time to wait these and finally get the feedback 
‘Connection timed out’ once and once again.
I thought this practical was really useful. It can let me be familiar with 
several commands in Linux system and git.

Thanks, teacher.
